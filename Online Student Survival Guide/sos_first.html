<center><p><b>The most important step in being a successful online student is setting yourself up on the first day of class. This will save you a lot of time later, and give you some breathing room when life unexpectedly
happens(and you know it will!).</b></p>
<p>Set aside at least an hour to do the followng tasks:</p></center>
       <ol>
	<li><b>Print the syllabus</b></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Make note of how to get in touch with the instructor.  Online instructors will often state if they prefer phone, text or email, 
		and if they have virtual office hours or how often they check email.</li>
		<li>Look at the list of assignments: When is each of them due?  How long do you think it will take you to complete each one? How many points is each one worth?
		Take a look at the details for the assignments or tests that are worth the most points; this will give you an idea of where you need to place your efforts.</li>
		<li> Place the due dates on a calendar; this can be a wall calendar, a day runner portfolio, or the Google calendar on your Smartphone.  
		Whichever you choose, make sure it is something that is with you at all times.  You want to be able to consult it when something comes up, such as a buddy asking 
		if you have time to catch a ballgame at the local pub.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Determine when you are going to study and work on homework.</b>  See the example schedule below.  Your schedule may look different
due to having a different work schedule, or maybe a custody arrangement with your kids, but be sure to make your education a priority by scheduling
it in to your week. Be realistic; you do need to plan in some down time and sleep. </li></ol>
